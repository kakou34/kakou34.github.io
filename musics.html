            <h4>Let her Go - Lyrics</h4>
            <p>Well you only need the light when it's burning low <br>
              Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go <br>
              Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <br>
              <mark> Only hate the road when you're missing home</mark> <br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              And you let her go<br>
              Staring at the bottom of your glass<br>
              Hoping one day you'll make a dream last<br>
              <mark>But dreams come slow and they go so fast</mark><br>
              You see her when you close your eyes<br>
              Maybe one day you'll understand why<br>
              Everything you touch surely dies<br>
              'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
              Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
              Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              Staring at the ceiling in the dark<br>
              Same old empty feeling in your heart<br>
              Love comes slow and it goes so fast<br>
              Well you see her when you fall asleep<br>
              But never to touch and never to keep<br>
              'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep<br>
              'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
              Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
              Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
              <mark>Only know you love her when you let her go</mark><br>
              And you let her go<br>
              Oh oh oh no<br>
              And you let her go<br>
              Oh oh oh no<br>
              And you let her go<br>
              Well, you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
              Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
              Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low<br>
              Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>
              Only know you've been high when you're feeling low<br>
              Only hate the road when you're missing home<br>
              Only know you love her when you let her go<br>

            <h4>Happier - Lyrics</h4>
            <p>Walking down 29th and Park <br>
              I saw you in another's arms <br>
              Only a month we've been apart <br>
              You look happier <br>
              Saw you walk inside a bar <br>
              He said something to make you laugh <br>
              I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours <br>
              Yeah, you look happier, you do <br>
              Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <br>
              But ain't nobody love you like I do <br>
              Promise that I will not take it personal, baby <br>
              If you're moving on with someone new <br>
              'Cause baby you look happier, you do <br>
              My friends told me one day I'll feel it too <br>
              <mark>And until then I'll smile to hide the truth</mark> <br>
              But I know I was happier with you<br>
              Sat on the corner of the room<br>
              Everything's reminding me of you<br>
              Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier<br>
              Aren't you?<br>
              Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
              But ain't nobody need you like I do<br>
              <mark>I know that there's others that deserve you</mark><br>
              But my darling, I am still in love with you<br>
              But I guess you look happier, you do<br>
              My friends told me one day I'd feel it too<br>
              I could try to smile to hide the truth<br>
              I know I was happier with you<br>
              Baby, you look happier, you do<br>
              I knew one day you'd fall for someone new<br>
              <mark>But if breaks your heart like lovers do</mark><br>
            <mark>Just know that I'll be waiting here for you</mark><br></p></div>

            <p 1st verse :<br>
              What will become of all those “I love you” that you used to whisper to me <br>
              When I’ll no longer have the same lifestyle, when I’ll no longer be hot<br>
              When the car will be gone, when the money will be gone, when I’ll become this broke guy again<br>
              When my dignity will be the only thing left<br>
              <mark>I’ve waited for my life to change for years</mark><br>
              <mark>Then I understood that she was the one waiting for me to change</mark><br>
              How much more dirt, how much more wrongs, before I change ?<br>
              <mark>A jerk’s brain and heart are such strange places</mark><br>
              <mark>I’ll go back to my father like rivers go back to the sea</mark><br>
              I’m mad at the world and at the tumor that killed him<br>
              Dad is gone, I didn’t even get the time to make him proud<br>
              I hope that you can see me from where you are and that you’re taking good care of my two grandmothers<br>
              Everything that I’m doing is done in order to get my family out of the trap<br>
              Bad boy, always absent when it’s time to pray<br>
              We were young we would call each other brothers until death<br>
              Today you’re the one that wishes it to me in your most hardcore thoughts<br>
              Chorus :<br>
              But I’m used to it, used to it, used to it<br>
              Used to it, used to it, used to it<br>
              Used to it, used to it, used to it<br>
              Used to it, used to it, used to it<br>
              2nd verse :<br>
              Centuries ago my ancestors were working on the fields<br>
              Today I’m blowing large amounts on les Champs Elysées<br>
              <mark>The euros on my account give me the impression that things have change</mark><br>
              <mark>The truth is that money goes back to the same people</mark><br>
              Tell me what will I leave behind apart from all the things that I’ve done ?<br>
              I would like to be remembered as the guy who dared to do anything<br>
              <mark>Baby, if I ever leave, dry your tears quickly, try to look happy</mark><br>
              <mark>Because on this earth, men don’t like cry babies</mark><br>
              People say that love is this, love is the other, that love is dead<br>
              <mark>I say that love is simple and that it’s our desires that mess things up</mark><br>
              And that the causes are nothing but the consequences of other causes<br>
              F**k the street, I only dream about seeing something different<br>
            (Chorus)<br></p>

            <h4>Perfect - Lyrics</h4>
            <p>I found a love for me <br>
              Darling just dive right in<br>
              And follow my lead<br>
              Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet<br>
              I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
              'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
              Not knowing what it was<br>
              I will not give you up this time<br>
              But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
              <mark>And in your eyes you're holding mine</mark><br>
              Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
              Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
              When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
              But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
              Well I found a woman,<mark> stronger than anyone I know</mark><br>
              <mark>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home </mark><br>
              I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
              To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
              We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
              Fighting against all odds<br>
              I know we'll be alright this time<br>
              Darling, just hold my hand<br>
              Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
              <mark>I see my future in your eyes</mark><br>
              Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
              Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
              When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
              I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
              Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
              Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
              I have faith in what I see<br>
              Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
              And she looks perfect<br>
              I don't deserve this<br>
            You look perfect tonight<br></p> </div>
